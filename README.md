# Dr._Semmelweis_and_the_Discovery_of_Handwashing

Using techniques, such as data manipulation, data visualization, probability and statistics, and data import and cleaning,
I evaluated the data that forms the basis of one of the most crucial discoveries in modern medicine - the importance of handwashing.

The two datasets I used are from Dr. Semmelweis's original 1859 publication 
<a href=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/the%20etiology,%20concept%20and%20prophylaxis%20of%20childbed%20fever.pdf>Ignaz Semmelweis: The etiology, concept, and prophylaxis of childbed fever.</a> 
Here are the details:

**datasets/clinic_data.csv**</p>
This contains yearly clinic-level data on births and maternal deaths in each of the two maternity clinics at Vienna General Hospital.
- year: each year from 1833 to 1858
- births: total number of births in the clinic
- deaths: number of maternal deaths in the clinic
- clinic: clinic (either clinic_1 or clinic_2). Doctors and midwives worked in Clinic 1, while only midwives worked in Clinic 2.

**datasets/hospital_data.csv**</p>
This contains yearly hospital-level data on births and maternal deaths.
- year: each year from 1784 to 1848
- births: total number of births at the hospital
- deaths: number of maternal deaths at the hospital
- hospital: hospital (either Vienna or Dublin). At the Vienna General Hospital where Dr. Semmelweis worked, doctors began performing pathological autopsies in 1823. At the Dublin Rotunda Hospital, doctors did not perform pathological autopsies at all.

This is a guided project I have done on the DataCamp platform. In a guided project, learners are provided with a set of instructions and a specific goal to achieve using a real-world dataset.
